# ðŸ“š C Projects â€“ Libmx & Pathfinder

Welcome to my C projects repository!  
This repo contains two major works written fully in C â€“ focusing on building solid foundations and solving classic problems from scratch.

---

## âš¡ Libmx
A custom library implementing many **base C functions** from scratch.

- No reliance on standard libraries for core logic  
- Great for practicing low-level programming  
- Reusable across multiple projects  

---

## ðŸ§­ Pathfinder
A project solving the **graph shortest path problem**.

- Works with weighted graphs  
- Finds optimal routes efficiently  
- Demonstrates algorithmic problem solving in C
